Final Project by: Matti Väisänen

This site was created for IoT and Web Development 2023 class at TAMK

HTML was created by using Bootstrap 5 and basic HTML.
Very little CSS was used as Bootstrap 5 is very versatile.

The javascript was created by me with the help of some ChatGPT (obviously).
I have seperated the javascript mostly into functions to keep it consice and easily readable.

getWeather function as the name suggests, gets the weather information from the API.
